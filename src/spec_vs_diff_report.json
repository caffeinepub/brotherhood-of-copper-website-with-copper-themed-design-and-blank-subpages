  "summary": "Implemented a new RanksPage component and updated routing so /ranks renders it while /divisions, /lore, and /history remain on BlankPage. However, due to truncation of RanksPage.tsx in the diff summary, it cannot be verified that all required sections/headings and all specified bullet lists (including Conductor divisions and the three conflict-resolution methods) are fully present and match the user-provided wording.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Render all user-provided Ranks sections (Leadership/Command/Specialist/Initiate) plus Internal Regulations & Culture, with all headings/subheadings and all bullet lists (including four Conductor divisions and three conflict-resolution methods) and matching user wording.",
      "reason": "The added RanksPage.tsx content is truncated; the visible portion shows the hero and part of Leadership (High Conductor, start of Conductor) but does not provide evidence for the full set of required sections (Command/Specialist/Initiate/Internal Regulations) nor the complete required bullet lists (including the four Conductor divisions and the three conflict-resolution methods).",
