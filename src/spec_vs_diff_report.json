  "summary": "HomePage.tsx was updated to render a banner image above the hero title with responsive sizing and meaningful alt text. However, the static asset itself was not added under frontend/public/assets/generated/, and there is no clear CSS/aspect-ratio technique shown to reserve space and prevent layout shift.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Add the uploaded banner image to the frontend as a static asset under `frontend/public/assets/generated/` (or equivalent) and reference it from the Home Page using a stable public path.",
      "reason": "The diff shows no added files, so the required PNG does not appear to be present in the repository under the specified public assets path (even though HomePage references it).",
      "evidence": [
        "File diff summary: \"Added: 0\" (no new static asset file)",
        "frontend/src/pages/HomePage.tsx (references `/assets/generated/brotherhood of copper banner.png`)"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Ensure the banner image does not cause layout shift (reserve height via CSS/aspect styling).",
      "reason": "HomePage adds an <img> with `w-full h-auto`, but no width/height attributes or aspect-ratio/reserved-height styling is shown in the diff snippet, so the acceptance criterion to prevent layout shift is not evidently implemented.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/pages/HomePage.tsx (img uses `className=\"w-full h-auto ...\"` with no visible aspect-ratio/size reservation)"
