  "summary": "HistoryPage.tsx was modified to include at least the first three updated Texhoma/Colt Mercer (2105) sections with new titles and narrative content, but the diff is truncated and does not provide enough evidence that all REQ-1/REQ-2 acceptance criteria (all eight sections I–VIII, exact required quote, tenets list in section VII, TOC + hash navigation behavior, and hero text updates) were fully implemented. Two additional non-requested files (frontend-file-summaries.txt and project_state.json) were also modified.",

      "reason": "The truncated diff does not show the Table of Contents rendering, anchor click handlers, hashchange handling, or smooth scrolling logic, so maintaining/updating in-page navigation cannot be verified.",
