REQ-2 (publish/redeploy failure) is not evidenced as resolved by the diff summary. Several changes (NotFound page and backend poster/profile authorization/logic changes) appear not explicitly requested by the BuildRequest.",

      "reason": "The diff shows `frontend/src/pages/PosterPage.tsx` still present (not removed). While the route/nav link were removed, the requirement calls for removing the page implementation so it is no longer part of the frontend build.",
