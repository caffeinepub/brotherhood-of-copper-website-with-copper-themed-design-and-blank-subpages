  "summary": "A new `UniformArmorVariantsByRankPage.tsx` page was added and routed to `/lore`, and it appears to include Section II content and copper-themed Card-based styling. However, the diff is truncated and does not provide enough evidence to confirm that all required ranks, exact bullet items (including punctuation/quoted terms), and all Section III required text/subheadings are fully and exactly implemented.",

      "reason": "The added page shows the Section II heading and partial content for High Conductor and Conductor, but the file is truncated, so there is no complete evidence that all nine ranks (through Copper-Bearer) are rendered in the required order and that every bullet item exactly matches the provided lists.",

      "reason": "The diff summary claims Section III exists, but the actual `UniformArmorVariantsByRankPage.tsx` content is truncated before any Section III text appears, so the required heading, exact intro sentence, subheading, ranks, and exact bullets cannot be verified from the provided evidence.",
