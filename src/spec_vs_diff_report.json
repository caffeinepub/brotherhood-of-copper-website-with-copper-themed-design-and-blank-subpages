  "summary": "The diff shows HomePage.tsx was modified and the repo summary claims a fictional-copyright disclaimer was added at the bottom with 14px styling. However, the provided HomePage.tsx diff is truncated before the bottom content, so key REQ-32 acceptance criteria (exact text match and last-on-page placement) cannot be verified from the available evidence.",

      "id": "REQ-32",
      "requirement": "Add a disclaimer at the very bottom of the Home page (frontend/src/pages/HomePage.tsx) in 14px font size with the exact text: \"This is a 100 percent fictional organization that isnt in fallout or any games of fallout. all fallout works are copyrighted and owned by Bethesda Game Studios.\"",
      "reason": "HomePage.tsx diff content is truncated before the end of the page, so there is no direct evidence showing (1) the disclaimer is the last block below the existing Call to Action section, (2) the disclaimer text matches exactly, and (3) the font size is explicitly 14px/text-sm and readable in both themes.",
