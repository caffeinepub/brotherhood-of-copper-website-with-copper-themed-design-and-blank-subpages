# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Expand the existing “Uniform & Armor Variants by Rank” page with new II and III sections that display the provided rank-based uniform/armor and war-era rank structure bullet lists.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a new section titled “II. Uniform & Armor Variants by Rank” to the existing page and render the specified ranks (High Conductor through Copper-Bearer) in order with their provided bullet items.
- Add a new section titled “III. Copper War–Era Rank Structure” with the provided introductory sentence and a “New / Temporary Ranks” subsection that renders the specified war-era ranks in order with their provided bullet items.
- Ensure the new sections match the existing copper-themed styling and remain readable on mobile and desktop without changing shared SiteLayout navigation/footer behavior.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors to the “Uniform & Armor Variants by Rank” page can read the newly added II and III sections, including all specified ranks and their exact bullet-list details, presented in the site’s existing style.
