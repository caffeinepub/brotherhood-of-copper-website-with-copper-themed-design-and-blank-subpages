# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a fictional-copyright disclaimer as the final content on the Home page.

**Planned changes:**
- Update `frontend/src/pages/HomePage.tsx` to render a disclaimer block at the very bottom of the page content (below the existing Call to Action section).
- Style the disclaimer text at 14px and ensure it remains readable in both light and dark themes.

**User-visible outcome:** Visiting the Home page shows the provided disclaimer text as the last content on the page in a 14px font size.
